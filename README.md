# Friends-DataStructures-Project

This is a past CS 112 Datastructures Project from Sophomore year.

Programmed a Friend-Network search system based on cliques of students and graph search algorithms 
(BFS/DFS).Able to find the shortest path from one friend to another if a path exists and can identify all the cliques of students 
that go to the same university in the graph structure with 100% accuracy.
Algorithm tested to work on graphs of over 300 unique students from multiple universities and over 500 edges, the text documents in the repository represent
sample graph sturctures one can test the program on.
